This is a copy of the famfamfam flag icons, created by Mark James, Birmingham, UK. It is intented to be used as git submodule.

Why?
---

There are some projects using the famfamfam flags icon set. Most developers simply put a copy of the flags icon set into their repository, wasting space. Using the flag icons as git submodule is more elegant and keeps your main repository pollution-free. As a bonus, you can fork and commit your own icons - and eventually merge them back.

Notes
-----

The flag filenames correspond to the [ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2
